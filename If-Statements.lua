--Looks Like Youve Completed The Introduction, Lets Dive More Deep Into ROBLOX Development With Your 2nd Lesson--

--What Are If-Statements--?:

--If Statements Basically Checks Something, Integers, Strings Or Booleans--
--Specificaly Used For A Little Advanced Logic--

--Heres An Example Of An If-Statement--:

local Integer = 15

if Integer > 15 then --The > Sign Is Used If A Value Is More Greater Than A Other Value Or < Sign Is Used For Value Less Greater Than The Other Value
    print("Integer Is More Than 15") --Gets Output After We Checked If Integer > 15
end
--What Does It Do---:

--In Line 13, Inside That Little Container Is Our Code If Our Statement Is > 15--
--So If-Statements Are Like This As A Little Example--:

--John: Hmm There Are 5 Sets Of Fruit On The Table
--John: If One Fruit Is Not The Same As The Others Lets Throw It Out

--Those Are If-Statements To Be More Friendly To You--
--To Let You Get An Understanding, Im Gonna Give Another Example Of If-Statement--:

local Apples = 5
if Apples < 5 then
    print("There Are 5 Apples")   
else
    print("Someone Ate A Apple")
end
--Thats Gonna Be The End Of Our Lesson, Hopefully Youve Messed Around With If-Statements To Get The Feel For It--
